# FixedPointTestProblems

[![Build Status](https://github.com/NicolasL-S/FixedPointTestProblems.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/NicolasL-S/FixedPointTestProblems.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

FixedPointTestProblems is a library of problems from various scientific disciplines to test the performance of fixed-point acceleration methods. They are adapted from research papers and tutorials. Since scarcely any sets of fixed-point problems exist in Julia (or anywhere), new contributions are most welcome.

The problems
1. Converge to a fixed point (which may not be unique) from reasonable starting values. (i.e. Let $F:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$, the series $x, F(x), F(F(x)),...$ should converge to a fixed point of $F$;
2. Are smooth;
3. Have mechanisms to avoid or correct erroneous input values (e.g. negative probabilities or non positive-definite variance-covariance matrices);
4. Present interesting challenges to solvers (they will not converge in a few iterations).

To install:
```Julia
] add FixedPointTestProblems
```
## API
Functions stored in the dictionary ``testproblems``.  To see the full list of problems:
```Julia
using FixedPointTestProblems
keys(testproblems)
```
All problems provide a starting point and an in-place mapping function, stored in a ``@NamedTuple``, generated by a function. To generate a problem:
```Julia
x0, map! = testproblems["Higham, correlation matrix mmb13"]()
```
To solve without acceleration:
```Julia
xin = copy(x0)
xout = similar(x0)
for i in 1:1000
    map!(xout, xin)
    norm_resid = norm(xout .- xin)
    println(i,  "  ", norm_resid)
    norm_resid < 1e-8 && break
    xin .= xout
end
```
For some problems like [EM algorithm applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm), an objective function is also available:
```Julia
	x0, map!, obj = testproblems["Mixture of 3 normals"]()
```
The problems can be generated with varying precisions, and sometimes varying specifications:
```Julia
	x0, map! = testproblems["Bratu"](;nx = 50, ny = 50, T = Float16)
```
To learn more about a problem and its available keyword arguments, it must first be extracted from the dictionary.
```Julia
p = testproblems["Bratu"]
? p
```
## Reproducibility and randomized problems
Many problems involve simulated random data. To make sure that they remain identical in all versions of Julia (and may potentially be reproduced in other languages), ``FixedPointTestProblems`` contains its own simple pseudo-random number generator. For data that must instead be loaded, it is housed in this repository.

For most problems, it is also possible to randomize the starting points and/or the problem data using the `randomize ` keyword argument. 
```Julia
	x0, map! = testproblems["Bratu"](;randomize = true)
```
